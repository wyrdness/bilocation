## Overview

Bilocation is the alleged **paranormal or miraculous ability to be in two different places at the same time**. Unlike astral projection or out-of-body experiences where consciousness travels, bilocation involves the complete physical body (or a perfect physical duplicate) manifesting in two locations simultaneously.

Bilocation appears most prominently in **Catholic hagiography**, with numerous saints reportedly possessing this ability. However, similar claims exist in other religious traditions, mystical practices, and paranormal accounts. **Scientifically, bilocation is considered impossible** as it violates fundamental physical laws, yet reports persist throughout history and across cultures.

The phenomenon raises profound questions about consciousness, physical reality, identity, and the nature of religious miracles. Reports range from **witnessed accounts by multiple observers** to more ambiguous experiences that might represent other phenomena (doppelgangers, visions, psychological projection).
